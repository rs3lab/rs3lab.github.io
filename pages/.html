<h2>Transient Operating System Design</h2>
<p>This project outlines solutions to further squeeze out the performance from the
OS in the context of locking primitives. Locking primitives are of paramount
importance to achieving good performance and scalability for applications.
Unfortunately, one lock is not always the best solution. Hence, we propose a new
approach called contextual concurrency control. Now, applications can fine-tune
the concurrency control mechanisms across both applications and the OS. To
realize this idea, we are designing a new lock control framework that allows a
developer to modify lock algorithms to minimize pathological issues either by
providing more semantics to the kernel or optimizing the lock algorithm for
specific hardware. The framework exposes a set of APIs that users can use for
designing new lock algorithms on the fly. Thus, users can fine-tune their
locking mechanisms without recompiling the OS.</p>
<p>In summary, the project aims to achieve the goal of evolving OS in the context
of concurrency. Our approach allows users to modify and synthesize lock
algorithms without OS recompilation. Our future plan is to take this approach to
its extreme, i.e., generating correct by construction locks. In other words, we
are working on designing a runtime framework that dynamically modifies locks for
various phases in an application life cycle. Not only that, the generated locks
are correct by construction and perform best by exploiting hardware behavior and
application requirements. Moreover, we can push the mathematically-verified lock
algorithms directly in the OS kernel, even including the application themselves.
In future, we envision that application developers can reason about the
performance of their application and further fine-tune it at finer-granularity.
Moreover, our approach opens the door for even modifying or synthesizing
application-specific data structures to cater to changing workload requirements.</p>

<h2>Scalable Storage Stacks</h2>
<p>With blazing fast IO devices, saturating them is becoming a difficult task.
Unfortunately, the current OS stack is the major bottleneck that is still
operating in the era of 2000s. As a part of this big project, we are looking at
ways to redesign the OS stack to support fast storage devices. We are working
on designing new ways to improves the design of file systems. Some of the
projects are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<!-- 1.  Designing new techniques to saturate and scale operations -->
<!-- for various storage media. -->
<!-- 2.  Understanding the implication of persistent memory (PM) over traditional -->
<!-- storage media, such as SSDs and HDDs. -->
<!-- 3.  Implication of computational SSDs over storage stack design. -->
<!-- 4.  Reconfigurable storage building blocks for designing. -->
<!-- 5.  Low cost memory management for fast storage media. -->
<!-- 6.  Micro-second task switching to overlap IO and computation. -->
</blockquote>
<!-- Our current -->
<!-- focus is how do we completely utilize the cumulative bandwidth of persistent -->
<!-- memory (PM) in a large multisocket machine. For instance, even with the -->
<!-- availability of hundreds of hardware threads in a machine, applications either -->
<!-- do not saturate the PM bandwidth or overwhelm hardware, as the OS has a -->
<!-- semantic gap of PM behavior. We are addressing this problem by designing a new -->
<!-- file system that saturates the bandwidth of PM across all sockets. Our current -->
<!-- design automatically parallelizes and delegates IO at the system call execution -->
<!-- layer.  Our initial prototype is an order of magnitude faster than all existing -->
<!-- PM-based file systems. To truly realize a practical and scalable file system -->
<!-- design, we plan to redesign the entire storage stack that supports various -->
<!-- types of storage devices, micro-second OS task scheduling, and low-cost memory -->
<!-- management. -->
