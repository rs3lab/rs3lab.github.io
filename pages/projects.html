<div class="section" id="transient-operating-system-design">
<h2>Transient Operating System Design</h2>
<p>The main goal of this big project is to dynamically modify various subsystems to
cater to heterogeneous hardware and varying application requirements.  Most of
the prior works focus on IO, while our focus is mostly on the concurrency
aspect. In particular, we are exploring how applications can fine-tune the
concurrency control mechanisms and underlying stack to improve their
performance. Some of the projects are as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A concurrency control runtime to efficiently switch between locks at various
granularity.</li>
<li>New low-level language to support lock design while ensuring lock
properties, such as mutual exclusion, starvation avoidance, and fairness.</li>
<li>A lightweight hypervisor that caters to various forms of virtualization:
bare-metal to serverless.</li>
<li>Re-architecting OS for microsecond IO.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will further extend this project to reason about data structures' concurrency
and consistency.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scalable-storage-stack">
<h2>Scalable Storage Stack</h2>
<p>With blazing fast IO devices, saturating them is becoming a difficult task.
Unfortunately, the current OS stack is the major bottleneck that is still
operating in the era of 2000s. As a part of this big project, we are looking at
ways to redesign the OS stack to support fast storage devices. We are working
on designing new ways to improves the design of file systems. Some of the
projects are as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Designing new techniques to saturate and scale operations
for various storage media.</li>
<li>Understanding the implication of storage class memory over
traditional storage media, such as SSDs.</li>
<li>Designing new storage engines for upcoming storage media,
such as ZNS SSDs.</li>
<li>Offloading file system stack to computational SSDs.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="concurrency-primitives-and-frameworks">
<h2>Concurrency Primitives and Frameworks</h2>
<p>With our particular interest in designing new synchronization primitives and
concurrency frameworks, we are looking at designing new primitives that further
squeeze the performance out of hardware for two scenarios: heterogeneous
hardware (such as BIG/Little architectures and high bandwidth memory) and
rack-scale systems. We are revisiting some of the primitives and trying to
reason about their practicality. Some of the ongoing projects are as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Revisiting the design of locking primitives for very large multicore
machines.</li>
<li>Redesigning concurrency primitives for microsecond scale
application in a rack scale environment.</li>
<li>Reasoning about various bugs in a concurrent environment.</li>

<h3>[Concurrency] Scalable Range Locks</h3>
<p>Range locks are one of the concurrency primitives that enable
disjoint data access parallelism within a range. Because of this,
they are now becoming a part of file system and memory management operations
in the Linux kernel. The aim of the project is to design and implement a new
primitive that provides the best of both worlds: low memory footprint and high
throughput in both low and high contention.</p>
<p>In this project, you will:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Profile the filesystem and memory-management subsystem to understand the
bottlenecks in current range lock implementation.</li>
<li>Implement a range lock and compare the performance with other state-of-the-art
range lock designs.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will learn about:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Synchronization primitives.</li>
<li>Benchmarking using software and hardware performance counter.</li>
<li>File system and memory management subsystem.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="concurrency-verified-concurrent-algorithms">
<h3>[Concurrency] Verified Concurrent Algorithms</h3>
<p>Concurrent algorithms are the basic building of today's infrastructure. However,
verifying their correctness is quite challenging. For example, the spinlock
code in the Linux kernel had a bug for several years. In this project, we aim to
verify the correctness of a set of concurrent algorithms using existing program
verifiers, such as dafny or coq. By doing this, we can not only enable
designing code that is not only scalable but also correct-by-construction from
day one.</p>
<p>In this project, you will:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Take an existing concurrent algorithm, specifically synchronization primitive.</li>
<li>Understand and come up with safety properties.</li>
<li>Implement the code in any verification language of your choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will learn about:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Concurrent algorithms.</li>
<li>Concurrent program verification.</li>
<li>Memory models.</li>
<li>Hardware behavior.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="robust-systems-developing-benchmarks-for-metastable-failures">
<h3>[Robust Systems] Developing benchmarks for metastable failures</h3>
<p>Metastable failures is a class of (mostly) distributed systems bugs that
manifest as a consequence of the interaction of various microservices in an
application: when in fact the individual components by themselves do not
exhibit these failures. This class failures are mostly applicable to datacenter
scale applications.  One key aspect of this class of failures is that systems
that enter a metastable failure state, usually cannot recover from it without
human intervention/system reboots. Moreover, they can be cascading in nature
causing outages for hours. In this project, we would like to develop benchmarks
to study these bugs better and come up with resolution mechanisms.</p>
<p>In this project, you will:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Study open reports of major outages at companies running applications at
datacenter scale.</li>
<li>Write a set benchmarks implemented as microservices with configurations
that can trigger metastable failure states.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will learn:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Distributed systems.</li>
<li>Dockers, k8s, microservice architecture, cloud application design.</li>
<li>Bug detection, testing and debugging.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="robust-systems-checking-semantic-correctness-of-concurrent-file-system-operations">
<h3>[Robust Systems] Checking semantic correctness of concurrent file system operations</h3>
<p>Semantic incorrectness or semantic bugs (e.g, specification violation, logical
bugs, and crash consistency bugs) of file systems can lead to data loss, file
system unavailability, etc. Thus it's critical to discover and fix them. There
are existing works related to semantic correctness checking. For example,
SibylFS checks whether the results of a sequence of file operations are
allowed by a mathematically rigorous model, which expresses the POSIX
specification. And Hydra emulates the allowed file system states when facing a
crash to discover crash consistency bugs. However, they only focus on the
single execution, which leaves the concurrent executions unexplored.</p>
<p>In this project, you will:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Collect existing semantic bugs caused by concurrent file operations.</li>
<li>Analyze the difference of semantic bugs between single and concurrent
execution scenarios.</li>
<li>Propose and implement a method to emulate file system states in the
concurrent execution scenario.</li>
<li>Compare the real running results with emulated results to decide the
correctness.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will learn:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Semantic bug analysis and detection.</li>
<li>Distributed file systems.</li>
<li>Fuzzing.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="storage-understanding-new-storage-devices">
<h3>[Storage] Understanding new storage devices</h3>
<p>Storage devices comes in various forms and factors. For instance, today's
machines are already equipped with flash based storage devices, such as SSDs.
However, there are several performance issues with the stack supporting current
SSDs, mostly because of how SSDs have been designed. To avoid some set of
problems, there are new devices coming in the market, such as Zoned Namespace
SSDs (ZNS), SmartSSDs, and persistent memory (PM). Hence, this projects aims to
understand the performance of storage stacks for these new storage media.</p>
<p>In this project, you will:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Evaluate the performance characteristics of any of these devices.</li>
<li>Design a set of benchmarks that specifically target such devices for various
scenarios.</li>
<li>Contrast their performance with SSDs.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will learn:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>File system design.</li>
<li>Scalability of storage stacks.</li>
<li>Behavior of existing storage hardware.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="storage-nvme-dummy-device-backed-by-memory-for-linux-nvme-driver">
<h3>[Storage] NVMe dummy device backed by memory for Linux NVMe driver</h3>
<p>One branch of our research is focused on improving performance of the Linux
kernel storage stack. However, this overhead is not significant with
traditional SSDs (NAND-based), because their latency is too high. Hence we must
use very expensive and now discontinued Intel Optane DC SSDs (3D XPoint-based)
to actually benchmark our improvements.</p>
<p>It means, that we cannot realistically measure the bottlenecks in the storage
stack until we have a new, faster storage devices. But researchers don't want
to wait for new hardware to appear. We want to have fast devices even before
they appear to be able to modify the software stack properly.</p>
<p>NVMe dummy device backed by main memory would allow us to have a virtual SSD
with extremely low latency and extremely high throughput. With that device, we
can build storage stack for the future.</p>
<p>In this project, you will:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Study Linux kernel driver for NVMe devices.</li>
<li>Implement a virtual NVMe device backed by main memory.</li>
<li>Optimize it for the lowest possible latency/highest possible throughput.</li>
<li>Benchmark its performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will learn:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>How to read a codebase of Linux kernel.</li>
<li>How to work with high-quality real-life code.</li>
<li>Necessary tools and practices for Linux kernel development.</li>
<li>How to write high-quality and high-performance code.</li>
<li>How to contribute to Linux kernel.</li>
