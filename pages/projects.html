<h2>Transient Operating System Design</h2>
<p>The main goal of this big project is to dynamically modify various subsystems to
cater to heterogeneous hardware and varying application requirements.  Most of
the prior works focus on IO, while our focus is mostly on the concurrency
aspect. In particular, we are exploring how applications can fine-tune the
concurrency control mechanisms and underlying stack to improve their
performance. Some of the projects are as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A concurrency control runtime to efficiently switch between locks at various
granularity.</li>
<li>New low-level language to support lock design while ensuring lock
properties, such as mutual exclusion, starvation avoidance, and fairness.</li>
<li>A lightweight hypervisor that caters to various forms of virtualization:
bare-metal to serverless.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will further extend this project to reason about data structures' concurrency
and consistency.</p>

<div class="section" id="scalable-storage-stack">
<h2>Scalable Storage Stack</h2>
<p>With blazing fast IO devices, saturating them is becoming a difficult task.
Unfortunately, the current OS stack is the major bottleneck that is still
operating in the era of 2000s. As a part of this big project, we are looking at
ways to redesign the OS stack to support fast storage devices. We are working
on designing new ways to improves the design of file systems. Some of the
projects are as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Designing new techniques to saturate and scale operations
for various storage media.</li>
<li>Understanding the implication of persistent memory (PM) over traditional
storage media, such as SSDs.</li>
<li>Offloading file system stack to computational SSDs.</li>
<li>Re-architecting OS for microsecond IO.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="concurrency-primitives-and-frameworks">
<h2>Concurrency Primitives and Frameworks</h2>
<p>With our particular interest in designing new synchronization primitives and
concurrency frameworks, we are looking at designing new primitives that further
squeeze the performance out of hardware for two scenarios: heterogeneous
hardware (such as BIG/Little architectures and high bandwidth memory) and
rack-scale systems. We are revisiting some of the primitives and trying to
reason about their practicality. Some of the ongoing projects are as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Making advanced synchronization primitives (combining/delegation) a reality.</li>
<li>Revisiting the design of locking primitives for very large multicore
machines.</li>
<li>Reasoning about various bugs in a concurrent environment.</li>
</ol>
