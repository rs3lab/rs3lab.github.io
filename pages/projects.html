<div class="section" id="transient-operating-system-design">
<h2>Transient Operating System Design</h2>
<p>The main goal of this big project is to dynamically modify various subsystems to
cater to heterogeneous hardware and varying application requirements.  Most of
the prior works focus on IO, while our focus is mostly on the concurrency
aspect. In particular, we are exploring how applications can fine-tune the
concurrency control mechanisms and underlying stack to improve their
performance. Some of the projects are as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A concurrency control runtime to efficiently switch between locks at various
granularity.</li>
<li>New low-level language to support lock design while ensuring lock
properties, such as mutual exclusion, starvation avoidance, and fairness.</li>
<li>A lightweight hypervisor that caters to various forms of virtualization:
bare-metal to serverless.</li>
<li>Re-architecting OS for microsecond IO.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will further extend this project to reason about data structures' concurrency
and consistency.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scalable-storage-stack">
<h2>Scalable Storage Stack</h2>
<p>With blazing fast IO devices, saturating them is becoming a difficult task.
Unfortunately, the current OS stack is the major bottleneck that is still
operating in the era of 2000s. As a part of this big project, we are looking at
ways to redesign the OS stack to support fast storage devices. We are working
on designing new ways to improves the design of file systems. Some of the
projects are as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Designing new techniques to saturate and scale operations
for various storage media.</li>
<li>Understanding the implication of storage class memory over
traditional storage media, such as SSDs.</li>
<li>Designing new storage engines for upcoming storage media,
such as ZNS SSDs.</li>
<li>Offloading file system stack to computational SSDs.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="concurrency-primitives-and-frameworks">
<h2>Concurrency Primitives and Frameworks</h2>
<p>With our particular interest in designing new synchronization primitives and
concurrency frameworks, we are looking at designing new primitives that further
squeeze the performance out of hardware for two scenarios: heterogeneous
hardware (such as BIG/Little architectures and high bandwidth memory) and
rack-scale systems. We are revisiting some of the primitives and trying to
reason about their practicality. Some of the ongoing projects are as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Revisiting the design of locking primitives for very large multicore
machines.</li>
<li>Redesigning concurrency primitives for microsecond scale
application in a rack scale environment.</li>
<li>Reasoning about various bugs in a concurrent environment.</li>

<div class="section" id="safety-security-online-ebpf-verifier-specification-explorer">
<h3>[Safety/Security] Online eBPF verifier specification explorer</h3>
<p>eBPF compilation today is tightly coupled to specific Clang and Linux-kernel versions,
and the safety guarantees enforced by the in-kernel eBPF verifier are opaque,
making it hard for developers and researchers to explore exactly which properties are being checked
either by running programs or manually checking the verifier.</p>
<p>Our latest research paper proposes and implements the first specification for eBPF verifier.
Now, we want to make that specification accessible and interactive---so
anyone can write small eBPF programs online and immediately see which safety checks they satisfy or violate.</p>
<p>To do so, this project aims to implement a website base on
[compiler explorer](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer">https://github.com/compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer</a>),
where users can:
- paste or write eBPF C code
- invoke our SMT-based verifier specification
- view detailed, human-readable feedback on which safety conditions pass or fail
- except the web site, you will also learn about SMT-based formal verification.</p>
<p>What You’ll Learn
- Web-application setup and deployment (host your own Compiler Explorer instance)
- Integrating a C-to-BPF toolchain (Clang + LLVM) with a custom back-end
- Encoding program properties into SMT formulas and interpreting solver outputs
- Basics of formal methods applied to low-level systems code</p>
<p>Prerequisite:
- Familiar with setting up and customizing web services (or eager to learn)
- Interest in formal verification, especially SMT-based approaches
- Familiarity with C programming and the Linux environment is a plus</p>

<h3>[Scalable OS] Admission control for system calls (Vishal Gupta)</h3>
<p>Multi-threaded applications increasingly use system calls to access shared
resources (Network, IO, CPU, Memory). In current design, system calls done in
parallel are admitted and it contends for resources. Increasing this
parallelism of system calls however results in diminishing returns. This
project aims to analyze this threshold and implement an admission control
mechanism for system calls.</p>
<p>In this project, you will:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Figure out thresholds for a set of system calls after which it results in
diminishing returns.</li>
<li>Implement an admission control mechanism and use it to implement the
admission control policy based on threshold.</li>

<h3>[Scalable OS] Continuous lock switching across Userspace and Kernel space (Vishal Gupta)</h3>
<p>Applications are increasingly becoming more complex and are being deployed on
heterogeneous hardware (NUMA, AMP etc.). However, in current systems, the lock
mechanism remains static. SynCord is the first framework to implement dynamic
lock switching for the kernel. This work proposes to extend the framework for
userspace applications. The end goal is to create a holistic framework to
change any locks across userspace and kernel space.</p>

<h3>[Scalable OS] Which lock is the best?  (Vishal Gupta)</h3>

<h3>[Scalable OS] Faster Uprobes using User Mode eBPF  (Kumar Kartikeya Dwivedi)</h3>
<p>BPF based tracing is used to execute programs and collect data when certain
functions are triggered in the kernel. The same is possible in user space using
the ‘user probes’ feature, where programs are executed when USDT probes are
triggered within the user space applications. However, currently the
implementation of uprobes requires trapping in to the kernel whenever an event
occurs, leading to slowdowns in applications, and being up to 2x slower than
system call context switches. This project explores whether the inception of a
new ‘user mode eBPF’ mode and making uprobes execute such program types in user
space will be faster and have the same level of usability. The ideal end goal
would be to attain transparent 100% compatibility with the current uprobe
mechanism.</p>
<p>In this project, you will:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Develop a deep understanding of the eBPF verifier’s static analysis process.</li>
<li>Create a new ‘user mode eBPF’ program type for eBPF.</li>
<li>Measure and benchmark usability and performance differences between the
current uprobe mechanism and the one based on user mode eBPF.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prerequisite:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A basic level of understanding of eBPF.</li>
<li>Proficiency in C and Python.</li>

<h3>[Systems for ML] Improving the performance of ML workloads (Yueyang Pan)</h3>
<p>ML workloads are at the center stage of the 21st century computing evolution.
However, software that runs them is not entirely efficient. Thus, to efficiently
utilize current hardware, whether for inference or training, within a single
machine or across machines, we need to understand and redesign the current
software stack.</p>
<p>In this project, you will:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Analyze and understand the overhead current software stack.</li>
<li>Do a complete breakdown of the cost associated within a single machine
and across machines for both inference and training.</li>
<li>Propose a set of optimizations that improves such systems performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prerequisite:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Using existing ML software.</li>
<li>Basics about ML algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will learn:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Understanding the performance of software systematically.</li>
