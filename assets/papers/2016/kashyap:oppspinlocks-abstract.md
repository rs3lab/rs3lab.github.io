With increasing demand for big-data processing and faster in-memory
databases, cloud providers are moving towards large virtualized instances
besides focusing on the horizontal scalability.

However, our experiments reveal that such instances in popular
cloud services (e.g., 32 vCPUs with 208 GB supported by Google
Compute Engine) do not achieve the desired scalability with increasing
core count even with a simple, embarrassingly parallel
job (e.g., Linux kernel compile). On a serious note, the internal
synchronization scheme (e.g., paravirtualized ticket spinlock) of
the virtualized instance on a machine with higher core count (e.g.,
80-core) dramatically degrades its overall performance. Our finding
is different from the previously well-known scalability problem (i.e.,
lock contention problem) and occurs because of the sophisticated
optimization techniques implemented in the hypervisorâ€”what we
call sleepy spinlock anomaly. To solve this problem, we design and
implement OTICKET, a variant of paravirtualized ticket spinlock that
effectively scales the virtualized instances in both undersubscribed
and oversubscribed environments.
